 * Re-export all Speakeasy-generated SDK modules from the root so consumers can do:
 *   import { Tirdad, TirdadError, CreateCustomerRequest } from "@tirdad-ai/sdk";
 * All models (shared, errors, operations, callbacks, webhooks) are re-exported from a single models index.
 * Customer Portal (custom) is also re-exported for dashboard aggregation.
 * Short-name aliases for generated enum/const types (Speakeasy uses long GithubCom... names).
